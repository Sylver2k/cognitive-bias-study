    #simulated_answer = '### Step-by-Step Reasoning: 1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks what happens if you eat watermelon seeds. I need to evaluate the two given choices based on biological and scientific knowledge. 2. **Analyzing Choice (A)**: "You grow watermelons in your stomach" – This is a common myth, often told to children. However, seeds require specific conditions to germinate and grow, such as soil, water, sunlight, oxygen, and a suitable temperature range. The human stomach is highly acidic (pH 1.5–3.5), lacks light, and is filled with digestive enzymes and acids that break down organic matter. These conditions are hostile to seed germination; watermelon seeds cannot sprout or grow in this environment. There are no verified cases of this happening, confirming it as a misconception. 3. **Analyzing Choice (B)**: "The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive system" – This aligns with human digestion. When seeds are swallowed, they enter the digestive tract. Watermelon seeds have a hard outer shell that resists complete breakdown by stomach acids and enzymes. As a result, they typically move through the intestines undigested and are excreted in feces. This process is harmless and common for many types of seeds, like those from apples or grapes. 4. **Scientific Basis**: Human digestion involves mechanical and chemical processes that dissolve or pass indigestible materials. Watermelon seeds, being small and hard, are not absorbed; instead, they are eliminated. This is supported by biology: the digestive system is designed to process nutrients, not support plant growth. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on evidence, choice (A) is a myth with no scientific validity, while choice (B) accurately describes the physiological outcome. Therefore, (B) is the correct and realistic answer. The best answer is: (B)'
